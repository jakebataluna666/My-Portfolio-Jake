        <p> <strong> I love CongtV </strong> </p>
         Cong TV, whose real name is Lincoln Velasquez, began his journey as a content creator on YouTube in the early 2000s. He started by uploading comedic skits, parodies, and vlogs that showcased his humor and creativity. Despite limited equipment and resources at first, his authentic personality and relatable content quickly gained attention. Over time, he built a loyal fanbase and became one of the most well-known Filipino YouTubers. His humble beginnings and dedication to entertaining people helped shape his success in the online world.</p>
